This is a module for accessing **Native Android AutoCompleteTextView.**
 
To install use the following command
~~`npm install autocompletetextview --save`~~ (Please read below section)

### Help Required

This module is built on the old version of React Native, if anyone is interested contribute by migrating it to new version please connect with me on rajsuvariya@gmail.com. It would be a great help to me and to the community.

Also, there were some issues while pushing it to npm so if you are installing it from npm then it won't work as expected. Will throw lot of errors like [https://github.com/rajsuvariya/autocompletetextview/issues/1].

Ad-hoc solution: If you need it very urgently then just clone the repo and copy paste required files, it should work as expected.
